= Integration Guide Example

I revised the https://codice.org/ddf[Distributed Data Framework] integration guide to be better suited for developers to use the endpoints and APIs of the system.

View the page http://codice.org/ddf/docs/integrating.html[Integrating with DDF] or download a http://codice.org/ddf/docs/integrating.pdf[PDF].

The intent of this document is to provide the URLs for each endpoint, demonstrate acceptable inputs, and show expected success and failure responses.
